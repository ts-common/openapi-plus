# openapi-plus
OpenAPI

## Proposed Features

### Improve API version support. 

Several options

1. Keep only files for the latests API version and use source control (Git) to reference old API versions
1. Have `dif` files for new API version.
   - this implementation requires a specific `dif` file format.
1. Keep all API version in one file
   - this implementation may require OpenAPI language changes.
